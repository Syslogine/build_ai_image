## Main Functionality
- Creates instances of various modules and classes (Agent, Environment, Communication, etc.).
- Iterates through a main loop, where agents perceive the environment, make decisions, act, update the environment, communicate, learn, visualize data, run simulations, monitor the system, coordinate with other agents, update knowledge base, predict future events, detect anomalies, optimize system, and learn using reinforcement learning.
- Each iteration of the loop simulates the behavior and interactions of agents in the environment, along with other system functionalities.
